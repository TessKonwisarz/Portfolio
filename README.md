Hello and welcome to my portfolio! 

This portfolio is a preview of my ever-growing Python coding skills that I have acquired, first introduced in a Neural Data Science course at Dalhousie University. I am passionate about the brain and behaviour, pursuing studies in Neuroscience and psychology.  
Learning to code has provided a more comprehensive perspective on the world of research, giving me skills to analyze data and interpret results to gain further insight into worldly occurrences.

## Python Coding Skills:
- Pandas DataFrame Manipulation and Merging
- Data Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Biomedical Image Analysis 
- Statistical Analysis

## Creating Pandas DataFrame

An example of code I wrote to format a [course schedule using pandas dataframe](CS_pd_df.md). 

## Examples of Data Manipulation for Interpretation

### Cleaning Datasets
Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
The dataset 'diet_data.csv' contains daily records of caloric intake and weight measurements over 140 days to assess the effects of a caloric deficit without diet restrictions on the participant's weight.   
To analyse the effects on the indivdual, the dataset has been cleaned and reorganized to simplify the dataseta to give greater focus to the data variables that answer research questions.    
Here is an example of [how to clean a dataset](Cleaning_diet_data.md).  

### Manipulating DataFrames 

After the data has been cleaned, it is useful to display the data in a table in a way that clearly displays the data collection results. A table will give a better idea as how to best plot the data to show the trends in order to answer a research question. <p>&nbsp;</p>
Here are some examples of how [groupby and pivot_table functions](groupby_pivot_table.md) can be used similarily to manipulate a dataframe and create a concise table representation of the data.

### Exploratory Analysis
Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
The dataset 'StudentsPerformance.csv' contains a sample of data recordings for student grade performance in different academic tasks, along with records of additional influencial variables.   
Here is an example of some [dataset visualisations](student_performance_exploration.md) to facilitate data analysis and determine if there is any additional variable influences on student performance.   
To view the student performance [bar graph](Graph.png) that pairs with the exploratory analysis coding in the preceding link.
