Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

## Coding Pandas DataFrame
An example of code I wrote to format a [course schedule using pandas dataframe](CS_pd_df.md). 

## Examples of Data Manipulation for Interpretation

### Cleaning Dataset
Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

The dataset 'diet_data.csv' contains daily records of caloric intake and weight measurements over 140 days to assess the effects of a caloric deficit without diet restrictions on the participant's weight.   
To analyse the effects on the indivdual, the dataset has been cleaned and reorganized to simplify the dataseta to give greater focus to the data variables that answer research questions.    
Here is the [cleaned dataset](Cleaning_diet_data.md).  

### Exploratory Analysis
Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

The dataset 'StudentsPerformance.csv' contains a sample of data recordings for student grade performance in different academic tasks, along with records of additional influencial variables.   
Here is an example of some [dataset visualisations](student_performance_exploration.md) to facilitate data analysis and determine if there is any additional variable influences on student performance.   
To view the student performance [bar graph](graph.png) that pairs with the exploratory analysis coding in the preceding link.
