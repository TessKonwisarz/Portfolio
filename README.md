Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

This portfolio is a preview of my ever-growing Python coding skills that I have acquired, first introduced in a Neural Data Science course at Dalhousie University. I am passionate about the brain and behaviour, pursuing studies in Neuroscience and psychology.  
Learning to code has provided a more comprehensive perspective on the world of research, giving me skills to analyze data and interpret results to gain further insight into worldly occurrences.

## Python Coding Skills:
- Pandas DataFrame Manipulation and Merging
- Data Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Biomedical Image Analysis 
- Statistical Analysis

## Creating Pandas DataFrame

Formatting a course schedule with Python, inputing data into a [dictionary then converting it to a pandas dataframe](cs2.md). 

## Examples of Data Manipulation for Interpretation

### Cleaning Datasets

Data can be messy when it is first collected, participants may not complete the necessary tasks, may drop out of the study, data may be disorganized, etc. Thus, cleaning the collected data is essential to allow proper manipulation and interpretation.

Analysing the effects of diet on an indivdual by [cleaning the dataset](diet.md), comparing useful variables and reorganizing the data into a DataFrame for easier analysis.  

### Manipulating DataFrames 

After the data has been cleaned, it is useful to display the data in a table in a way that clearly displays the data collection results. A table will give a better idea as how to best plot the data to show the trends in order to answer a research question.

Here are some examples of how [groupby and pivot_table functions](groupby_pivot_table.md) can be used similarily to manipulate a dataframe and create a concise table representation of the data (Datasets imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)).

### Exploratory Analysis

The exploratory analysis helps to visualize the data so to notice any trends or effects within the data comparisons and thus, facilitate data analysis.

Displaying [bar plots](bar_plot.htm) to compare the effects of gender on academic performance using student performance dataset (Dataset imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)).

Displaying the same data for academic performance, instead using [boxplots](boxplot_performance.htm)

## MRI Imaging Visualization

Reading images from personal axial plane lumbar spine [MRI imaging dataset](MRI.htm), viewing all spine cross-sections in subplots and reslicing the data for coronal imaging plane.

## EEG Data Cleaning and Visualization

How I cleaned and plotted some [EEG data](EEG.htm)
